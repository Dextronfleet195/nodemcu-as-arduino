# NodeMCU + OLED
## Notes:
These sketches interface with an OLED screen connected via I2C on pins D3 and D4 of the NodeMCU board. (Pins can be changed as desired.)

## Credit
`PlaneSpotter`, `WeatherStation`, and `WorldClock` are all forks of sketches written by Daniel Eichhorn. (He's also responsible for the excellent display driver I've made liberal use of.) I made modifications, such as removing the internal temperature sensor measurements, modifying time setting, etc. to fit my use cases.
